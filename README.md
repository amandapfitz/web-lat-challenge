# web-lat-challenge

I have created a webpage using a dataset that I created from API. The data is weather information for
cities pulled at random by their longitude and latitude. The graphs that are on display on the website
were created using Matplotlib and the data was cleaned using Pandas. Below are details about the website.

The website consists of 7 pages total, including:

A landing page containing:

An explanation of the project.
Links to each visualizations page.


Four visualization pages, each with:

A descriptive title and heading tag.
The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.


A "Comparisons" page that:

Contains all of the visualizations on the same page.


A "Data" page that:

Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
